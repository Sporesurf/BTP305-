# BTP305-
This course expands the student's skill-set in object-oriented programming and introduces the student to threaded programming. The student learns to model relationships between classes using containers, inheritance hierarchies and polymorphism in the C++ programming language and to write C++ programs that execute on multiple threads.

#Learning Outcomes
1. Design collections of model objects using sequential containers and multi-dimensional arrays to solve a complex systems or business problem
2. Create function objects and closures to customize a programming solution for a particular application
3. Model generalization and specialization using single and multiple inheritance to minimize the duplication of code in complex hierarchies
4. Model polymorphic behavior using interfaces, virtual functions and templates (generics) to amplify the reusability of code
5. Implement design components using algorithms of the standard template library to utilize existing technologies
6. Create program components of quadratic complexity to solve non-linear problems
7. Design program components using raw pointers, pointer arithmetic and smart pointers to access data in program memory
8. Design multi-tasked solutions using threading libraries to improve the performance of a program
9. Design file stream objects to backup text and binary data for future restoration
10. Trace the execution of program code that includes a linked list to debug an application
